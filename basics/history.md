# History of Node.js
- Before Node.js came out, we could only run JS on the browser.
- 2009, Ryan Dahl forked v8 and made it so we can run JS on the computer.
- Became popular and widely adopted due to allowing JS to be ran on the server.

# Non blocking I/O
- You can run this in parallel due to an event loop
